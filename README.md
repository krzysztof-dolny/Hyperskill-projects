# Hyperskill-projects
These are 3 projects that I've done during Python Core course developed by JetBrains company. 
Projects: 
1. bill_spliter - designed to split a bill among a group of friends.
2. hacker - password cracking tool that attempts to establish a connection with a specified IP address and port by guessing the login credentials through a brute-force attack.
3. static_code_analyzer - script designed to analyze Python source code files (.py) and identify potential issues based on specific coding standards and practices. It checks for various criteria such as line length, indentation, semicolons, comment spacing, blank lines, class and function naming conventions, as well as mutable default arguments. The script can be executed by providing the path to a single file or a directory containing multiple Python files. It generates a report of identified issues, including their respective line numbers and descriptions.
